- implement searchBar -- need to implement linking to proper blog, post or user on click.
- make sure all posts contained within a public blog have isPublic attribute set to 1 -- believe is done
- move code needed to determine editability to post or user class. -- moved to post, untested as I need to access a blog from a user that is not the author.
- disable login and register bar once logged in
- disable searching if no searcTerm is provided or blog,user or post option are not chosen.
 
- implement database class: 
	implement rollBack functionality during transactions...
	implement sycronization of transactions
- Help Vince with privileges on ongoing basis.

random db stuff to aid in development. 

if retrieving the author of a blog

if the currentuser is the author in blog - can use username of currentUser

but what if the user is a public user
	then I need to retrieve blogid based on the title
	then userid based on blogid within user_blog
	then username from user based on userid
	
	select u.userId as userId from blog b, user_blog ub, user u where
	b.blogId = 1 AND
	b.blogId = ub.blogId AND u.userId = ub.userId;

NEED to modify build from title to retrieve author without depending on the user being logged in.

selecting author of post based on postid

select username from user
where userId = 
(select u.userId from user u, post p, user_post up
where p.postId = 15 AND
u.userId = up.userId AND
p.postId = up.postId);
