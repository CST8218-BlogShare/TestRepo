if retrieving the author of a blog

if the currentuser is the author - can use authorid

but what if the user is a public user
	then I need to retrieve blogid based on the title
	then userid based on blogid within user_blog
	then username from user based on userid
	
	select u.userId as userId from blog b, user_blog ub, user u where
	b.blogId = 1 AND
	b.blogId = ub.blogId AND u.userId = ub.userId;

NEED to modify build from title to retrieve author without depending on the user being logged in.

selecting author of post based on postid

select username from user
where userId = 
(select u.userId from user u, post p, user_post up
where p.postId = 15 AND
u.userId = up.userId AND
p.postId = up.postId);
