log in as Derek

create blog that is not publicly editable
make two posts, second one is editable
logout - search for post, should be editable 
login as different user - search for post, should be editable - 

works as should


create blog that is publicly editable
create posts - should be publicly editable - with isPublic checked
logout 
searchBlog - all posts should be editable - with isPublic checked

if a user is editing a post and the blog is deleted. 

the user will first check if the blog is deleted,
then if the post is deleted. 

this allows me to not add all posts to the postDeleted table on blog removal 

if the user is creating a post, there is not chance the post has been deleted.
